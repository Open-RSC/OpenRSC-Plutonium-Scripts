Welcome to my RSC Plutonioum Scripts Repository!

Plutonium is a command-line packet bot. You can get it here: https://gitlab.com/open-runescape-classic/plutonium/

The only script of interest is `get_base_50s.py`, an AIO script that progresses a character all the way from Tutorial island to level 50 in all skills. Feel free to use and improve it.
